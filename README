The JVM is a stack-based bytecode interpreter with profile-driven JIT
compilation. So is Rubinius.

I like the following analogy: a funnel makes it easy to pour in one
direction. Pouring Ruby semantics into the JVM is like using a funnel
backwards. Let's turn this funnel right-side up and pour Java bytecode
into Rubinius.
